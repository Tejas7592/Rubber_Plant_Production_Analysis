# Rubber_Plant_Production_Analysis
This repository contains the visualization and resources for my Data Analyst internship project at a rubber manufacturing plant. The project involved analyzing production rates using part names and a dummy dataset (original part names, but fake prices due to confidentiality) and creating a Power BI dashboard for visualization.
